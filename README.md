# Data-Product-Interoperability
This is the appendix for our paper [Data Product Management: An Industrial Perspective](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-26507-5_19), presented at the [WESOACS](https://icsoc2022.spilab.es/accepted-workshops/) workshop of the [ICSOC 2022](https://icsoc2022.spilab.es/) conference.

Scenarios_for_Interoperable_Metadata_Management.pdf Describes 4 scenarios that were used to validate the effectiveness of our approach for addressing the identified requirements. The folder "Mockups" contains various images that were created to illustrate what our proposed solution could look like.
